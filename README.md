This project contains multiple tools for solving for geodesics in curved spacetime.

It first calculates Christoffel symbols from the metric tensor, then uses those to calculate geodesics using a slightly modified version of Euler's method.

Its output can be copied and pasted into [Desmos3D](https://www.desmos.com/3d) to visualize the data.
